## Running the tutorials
There are at least two ways you can run the tutorials:
1. Run the tutorials from your host machine which has a recent `ngsxfem` installed with 
``` {.shell}
jupyter notebook *.ipynb
```

2. or run `ngsxfem` interactively in the cloud without any local installation through the [binder service](
